 * Runs a benchmarking program through a Graphic User Interface (GUI) using Swing.
 * It saves information about each benchmark to keep a recording of all benchmarking.

 * The App class is where everything will run and sets all the variables.
 * The DiskMark class will track and record all the progress as the disk is reading or writing.
 * The DiskWorker class runs the disk benchmarking by the help of extending to a Swing class called SwingWorker.
